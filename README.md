# Glass-responsive-website
Creating a responsive website with theme Glass effect inspired by Dev Ed in Youtube.

This website is Design Responsive: 
  compatible to 400 to 1440px. 
 
 This website is inspired by the design of sir Ed on Youtube. But the difference with my work is that, I used SASS instead of ordinary CSS. 
 It was a good exercise for me to be more familiar with using the SASS.
